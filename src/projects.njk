        text, or words, are not the medium i feel most comfortable with. that's why i want
        to take the opportunity to show some of my side projects. check out the source
        code if you want to get an idea of how i like to code.
    </p>
    <p>
        over the years the setup has become simpler and the result, in my opinion, much
        more interesting.

        however, my main side project is not listed here &mdash; it's the website that
        you're currently visiting. take a look at the
        <a href="/time-machine/">time machine</a> to see a collection of the different
        versions that this site has gone through.
