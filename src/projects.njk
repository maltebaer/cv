    <p>
        text, or words, are not the medium i feel most comfortable with. that's why i've
        collected these side projects here, to let my code do the talking for me.
    </p>

    <p>
        each project has source code linked so you can get a feel for how i approach
        problems and structure solutions. you may notice that over the years my setups
        have gotten simpler while the results, in my opinion, have gotten more
        interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
        curious about my main side project? you're looking at it. this site has gone
        through several iterations, which you can explore in the
        <a href="/time-machine">time machine</a> section to see how my approach to web
        development has matured.
